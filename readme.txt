This project is recreation of Cher's closet from 
the movie Clueless. There are tops and bottoms
preloaded into the program and the user can browse
throw the tops and bottoms to make outfits. There
is also the option for the program to randomly 
select a top and/or bottom for the user. There is an option for a store that
gives you tanks, tees, skirts, and shorts. You have a preloaded amount of coins 
which is 500 and each time you buy a new piece of clothing the money goes down. 
The user can press the "Dress Me" button to visualize the 
outfit on a mannequin. The user can press the 
"grade" button and the outfit will be graded
on how well it matches. If it is a perfect match, coins get added back. There is
a handtracking feature that allows for you to go through the clothes with your
fingers. There is also a try on feature that allows you to try your clothes on
and use handtracking to change the clothes.
