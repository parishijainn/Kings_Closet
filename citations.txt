Below the dashed line, include easily understandable and verifiable 
citations to all the major sources you used for your project, as described
in the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#tp-policies

In addition, your code must also include citations directly in the code that 
make it clear where you use code that is partly or entirely not of your 
original design, and what the source is for that code.

-- Virtual Try On --
-  I used this video to help me figure out how to 
navigate openCV, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C7R24-Ze10
- Swipe-cooldown logiC : I used AI help to discover how to 
leverage Python’s time module to enforce a cooldown 
between each swipe event in the try-on loop. 

- Alpha blending implementation: I used AI guidance to figure
 out how to blend the RGBA overlay PNG into
  the BGR camera frame—specifically how 
  to extract and apply the alpha channel 
  for smooth transparency

- Landmark midpoint calculation: 
I used AI to derive the formula for computing 
the midpoint between two pose landmarks 
(shoulders, hips) so that the 
overlays would center correctly on the body.
